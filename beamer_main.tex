		{What is Computer Networking?}
		Computer Networking is the practice of interconnecting computers
		to share resources and exchange data. Networks can be as simple
		as connecting two computers or as complex as the global Internet.
	\end{frame}
	\begin{frame}
		{Types of Networks}
		Computer networks can be classified into different types based on
		their size and purpose:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{LAN}-Local Area Network, typically within a building or
			campus.
			\item
			\textbf{WAN}-Wide Area Network, spanning large geographical
			areas.
			\item
			\textbf{MAN}-Metropolitan Area Network, larger than LAN but
			smaller than WAN.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	\begin{frame}
		{Network Topologies}
		Network topology refers to the layout of how devices are connected
		in a network:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item
			\textbf{Bus Topology}- All devices share a single communication line.
			\item
			\textbf{Star Topology}- Devices are connected to a central hub.
			\item
			\textbf{Ring Topology} - Devices form a closed loop.
			\item
			\textbf{Mesh Topology}- Devices are interconnected with many
			redundant connections.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}
		{Networking Layers}
		The OSI model is divided into seven layers, which allows for
		abstraction and modularity in networking.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Physical Layer\pause
			\item Data Link Layer\pause
			\item Network Layer\pause
			\item Transport Layer\pause
			\item Session Layer\pause
			\item Presentation Layer\pause
			\item Application Layer
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	\begin{frame}
		{Network Protocols Comparison}
		Here’s a comparison of some common networking protocols:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{table}[h]
				\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline
					\textbf{Protocol}&\textbf{Layer}&\textbf{Use Case}&\textbf{Port Number} \\ \hline
					HTTP&Application&Web Traffic&80 \\ \hline
					HTTP&Application&Web
					Traffic&80 \\ \hline
					FTP&Application&File Transfer&21 \\ \hline	TCP&Transport&Reliable date Transfer&N/A \\ \hline	IP&Network&Routing Packets&N/A \\ \hline	Ethernet&Data Link&LAN Communication&N/A \\ \hline
				\end{tabular}
			\end{table}
		\end{center}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}
		{Data Transmission Formula}
		The data transmission rate formula in networking is:
		\[\text{Data Rate} = Bandwidth\times\log_{2}
		{(1+\text(Signal-to-Noise Ratio))}\]
		where:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Bandwidth is the maximum frequency range (in Hz).
			\item Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is a measure of signal strength
			relative to background noise.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}
		{Key Networking Components}
		\begin{block}{Router}
			A device that forwards data packets between networks.
		\end{block}
		\begin{block}{Switch}
			A device that connects devices within a LAN, managing data
			transmission between them.
		\end{block}	\begin{block}{Firewall}
			A security system that monitors and controls network traffic based
			on security rules.
		\end{block}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{IP Addressing}
		Each device in a network has a unique IP address for identification. \\
		IP addresses are of two main types:
		
		\vspace{0.5cm}
		
		IPv4:192.168.1.1 IPv6: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
		
		\vspace{0.5cm}
		
		IPv4 is widely used, but IPv6 addresses are becoming more common to accommodate more devices.
	\end{frame}
	\begin{frame}
		{OSI Model}
		The OSI model defines a layered framework for how data is
		transmitted over networks:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Layer 1: Physical} - Hardware transmission (cables, signals).
			\item \textbf{Layer 2: Data Link}- Error detection and frame control.
			\item \textbf{Layer 3: Network}- Routing of packets (e.g., IP).
			\item \textbf{Layer 4: Transport}- End-to-end communication (e.g.,
			TCP).
			\item \textbf{Layer 5-7} - Session, Presentation, and Application layers.
		\end{itemize}

	\end{frame}
	\begin{frame}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{HTTP/HTTPS}- For web browsing and secure data
		transmission.
		\item\textbf{FTP/SFTP}- For file transfers.
		\item \textbf{SMTP}- For sending emails.
		\item \textbf{DNS}- Domain Name System, for resolving domain names to
		IP addresses.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	\begin{frame}
		{Networking Security Basics}
		\begin{block}{Encryption}
		Protects data by encoding it, making it accessible only to those
		with the correct key.
		\end{block}
		\begin{block}{Firewalls}
			Monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based
			on security policies.
		\end{block}
		\begin{block}{VPN}
			A Virtual Private Network creates a secure connection over a
			public network.
		\end{block}
	\end{frame}

		{Conclusion}
		Networking enables connectivity across devices and allows sharing
		of resources. Understanding basic network types, topologies, and
		security measures is essential for creating and maintaining effective
		networks.
